With all the test passing, the code is not optimized for large scale operations.
Looking at the Anagrams model, we can do a good bit of the work when storing a word.
That way we do not have to get the letter counts of each word everytime.

So step one - store the letter counts in the Word object.

Next - we need to be able to send a query to the db to find words that match the letter counts of the existing word

What if we created a special "KEY" that was the same for words with matching letter counts then indexed on this key
We would then only need to get the "KEY" of the new word and find words with that matching key!

Proposal
The key is simply
["a1b4o3z2"]

where we have the letter then the count for each one, concatenated in a string

Requirement: THE LETTER ORDER MUST BE THE SAME EACH TIME
